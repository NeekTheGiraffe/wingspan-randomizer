# Wingspan Randomizer

This project creates a random Duet Map from [Wingspan Asia](https://stonemaiergames.com/games/wingspan/wingspan-asia/). Duet mode is great, but it has the exact same map every game, so I hope this adds some spice ;)

The map is seedable with link sharing, enabling reproducible results. However, I am actively working on the algorithm, so results may change between releases.
